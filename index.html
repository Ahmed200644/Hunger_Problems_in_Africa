            affected kid is one too much. Malnutrition leads to physical and

                According to UN data, 165 million children worldwide are too
                small for their age, or stunted, due to chronic malnutrition.
                Three quarters of these children live in sub-Saharan Africa and
                South Asia. In sub-Saharan Africa, 40% of children are affected;
                in South Asia, 39%. 3.2 million children under the age of 5 die
                each year in sub-Saharan Africa - that's about half of the
                world's deaths in this age group. Worldwide, nearly every second
                death in children under the age of five is due to malnutrition.
                As this weakens the immune system, diseases such as pneumonia,
                malaria or diarrhea often led to death. The sub-Saharan child
                mortality rate is one of the highest in the world, with one in
                nine children dying before the age of 5. In Sierra Leone, one in
                every six children dies before the age of 5. Especially young

              <h3>TRANS-BORDER SOLUTIONS:</h3>
              <p>
                Climate change does not respect boundaries hence it is necessary
                for African countries to work together to build resilience to
                its adverse weather effects. Many of the countries in Africa’s
                five regions share trans-border natural resources on which
                millions of livelihoods depend. Countries within the same region
                share ecosystems that are subject to similar climate change
                impacts on livelihoods. In these situations, regional
                collaboration can provide the best strategy in working together
                to safeguard the common trans-boundary ecosystems. Regional
                approach to development can enhance African countries’
                competitiveness for economic growth and can also address human
                security issues in Africa. Human security means access to life’s
                basic needs such as food, shelter, clothing, education and
                health care, as well as the non-material conditions of human
                existence like freedom, liberty and participation in the
                decisions of the community that affect their lives. Around the
                world, regional approach has successfully improved human
                security. For example, through cross-border collaboration,
                security issues related to water quality, fishery and flooding
                was greatly improved in Rhine River in Europe and similarly,
                water security was greatly improved in Lake Uromiyeh in Iran.
                Also the SARS and avian flu pandemics were fought jointly in the
                Asia region. A regional approach to ecosystem-based adaptation
                can serve as a flexible and cost-effective solution for
                addressing food security problems as it strengthens ecological
                foundation of food systems. It also increases the resilience of
                the systems to adverse impacts, protects and restores critical
                natural resources that communities depend on, especially for the
                poor. A good example is the reforestation of mangroves in the
                Xai-Xai District in Mozambique which restored the ecosystem,
                which in turn increased fishery productivity and yields. Also,
                the adoption of Zaï Pit technique (placing a mixture of soil and
                manure in small pits in degraded lands) in the Sahel led to
                increased soil fertility, decreased soil erosion and increased
                crop yields.

              <h3>THE POWER OF WORKING WITH NATURE:</h3>
              <p>
                The UNEP’s regional approach ecosystems-based adaptation for
                food security programme is charting a new paradigm shift in
                addressing food security across the continent. Food security
                ought to be looked at at a regional rather than national level
                because regional integration, if driven by foods security
                concerns, has a lot of potential for development in Africa. This
                approach will ensure that limited resources are prioritized and
                targeted towards the most effective solutions and therefore
                reduce the overall adaptation costs. Through cross-border
                coordination, region-specific knowledge and tools can be
                developed jointly to accelerate adaptation planning. Ecosystem
                monitoring and assessment programmes can also be conducted
                jointly to provide integrated, high-quality information for
                decision-making across countries. Best practices can be shared
                and implemented across countries to accelerate capacity
                building. In addition, management practices implemented by one
                country could affect ecosystem services and food security of
                others. Coordinated adaption planning at regional level can
                involve multiple stakeholders to assess tradeoffs, reconcile
                multiple objectives and make joint decisions. This approach
                provides an effective tool for African countries to work
                together in safeguarding common trans-boundary ecosystems,
                improving climate change resilience and building sustainable
                food systems. It corresponds with the African Union’s
                commitments in Maputo Declaration (2003) and the Malabo
                Declaration (2014) on accelerating agricultural development and
                transformation, and the objectives of Comprehensive Africa
                Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP). It can, therefore, be
                implemented as a regional strategy for coordinating all the
                regional efforts in addressing food security, climate change, as
                well as enhancing the productivity of the very ecosystems that
                underpin economies and livelihoods. Therefore, stronger
                political and financial support should be invested in wider
                implementation of such projects in Africa. This will foster a
                future that is not marked by conflict but by cooperation, not by
                human suffering, but by human progress as we seek to achieve, in
                the words of Nelson Mandela, “an Africa where there is work,
                bread, water and salt for all’.
